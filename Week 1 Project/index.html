          <h1>Hi I'm Karen!</h1>
          <p> I'm a first year CS major at UCSD. In my free time, I enjoy reading,
          hiking, and swimming. I enjoy computer science because it encourages me to 
          think creatively and incorporates both math and logic! I'm very excited to be 
          working with you guys this quarter!</p>
