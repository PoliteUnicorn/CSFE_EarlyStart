  <h1>Hi I'm Karen!</h1>
  <p> I'm a first year CS major at UCSD. In my free time, I enjoy reading,
  hiking, and swimming. I enjoy computer science because it encourages me to 
  think creatively and incorporates both math and logic! I'm very excited to be 
  working with you guys this quarter!</p>
